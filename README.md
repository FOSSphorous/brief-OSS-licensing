# brief-OSS-licensing

A not-at-all extensive introduction to the world of open source licensing for the lazy.

#### Preface

I am not a copyright lawyer, or a lawyer at all for that matter (though I may have plans for that to change). I am definitely not your lawyer. If you are looking for official legal advice then you should go contact one of those. They will let you know how much responsibility they feel like taking for anything that may come as a result of following it.

For me, personally, that will be none.

At all.

## What If There's No License?

Your code/work becomes read-only as far as everyone else is concerned. Under most nations' copyright laws it will be "all rights reserved" for the person who wrote it. You really *aren't* supposed to make copies or utilize it in any way outside of "fair use" exceptions, which always require a court getting involved if flagged by the originator and disputed by the user/distributor. After a while it may end up in the public domain as free to use shareware. If you would like to utilize unlicensed software that isn't in the public domain then you would generally have to go to the source and get explicit permission to do so (in writing or some other permanent format if you don't want to risk expensive legal trouble later on). Developers tend to be reluctant to use it since you haven't given them real permission to do so. 

Usually a lack of a license happens because people aren't aware of the importance of licensing their code. A lot of people who *intentionally* don't bother licensing their code are usually of a belief where they are thinking to themselves "Of course people can use my code, I wouldn't/can't take anyone to courts for it. Feel free to."

If that describes you then that's very nice, a lovely sentiment.

Now please put that sentiment in text. Preferably in a document that says "LICENSE" and is out in the open for everyone to see.

Or, better yet, choose one of the already existing and extensively reviewed open source licenses that best fits your use-case.

## Copyright/Proprietary

You will need permission to apply the code to places elsewhere and are often charged a fee for doing so. These licensces place restrictions on modification and redisribution. Microsoft, AT&T, and IBM were pioneers in the field of proprietary software licensing within the USA. Before then most software was regarded as shareware without a license.

When you come across proprietary software it will often (though not always) be distributed in precompiled, binary format, and make you aware of the license via EULA (End User License Agreement) or similar document.

## Copyleft/"share and share-alike" (can be further divided into "strong copyleft" and "weak copyleft") 

<strong>Examples:</strong>
<ul>  
  <li><a href="https://tldrlegal.com/license/gnu-general-public-license-v3-(gpl-3)">GPLv3</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://tldrlegal.com/license/open-software-licence-3.0">Open Software License (3.0)</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/legalcode">CC BY-SA </a>(a Creative Commons license)</li>
  <li><a href="https://tldrlegal.com/license/mozilla-public-license-2.0-(mpl-2)">Mozilla Public License (2.0)</a></li>
</ul>

Any derivatives must allow redistribution of the software as well as modifications, and the license will have to be retained (in most cases). Retaining in this instance will mean that the derivative/offshoot will possess the same license as its source. Some of the stronger licenses like the GPL "absorb" copycenter (like the BSD), where the requirements of forks and changes of the GPL licensed code take precedence over that of the BSD licensed code. Make sure you are aware of the code and libraries that you make use of. You can find them in anything GNU, and the linux kernel [uses the GPLv2](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v6.15/process/license-rules.html) as of this time.

The GPL more or less amounts to "sure, you can have this thing but if you do something with it then send me your changes back and have everyone be able to see the source code." This can be a good way of ensuring your work may stay open source and that improvements/changes remain available to your development community.

## Copycenter/Permissive

<strong>Examples:</strong> 
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://tldrlegal.com/license/bsd-2-clause-license-(freebsd)>BSD 2-Clause</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://tldrlegal.com/license/apache-license-2.0-(apache-2.0)">Apache license (2.0)</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license">MIT license</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://unlicense.org/">Unilicense</a></li>
</ul>

This software is free to use still. The licenses are often a bit more flexible than a copyleft, not requiring that the code be distributed/available. [This category has](https://resources.whitesourcesoftware.com/blog-whitesource/open-source-licenses-trends-and-predictions) [been the most used](https://resources.whitesourcesoftware.com/blog-whitesource/top-10-open-source-software-licenses-of-2016-and-key-trends) for years because it allows people and companies to use open source software without impacting the distribution by requiring that they *need* to disclose it in source code format (e.g. one can just give out pre-compiled binaries). For example, BSD licensed code is found used in Sony's products (e.g. [the playstation 4](https://doc.dl.playstation.net/doc/ps4-oss/index.html)), Nintendo's consoles ([the Switch](https://wololo.net/wagic/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/nintendo_switch_freebsd_hack.jpg) and [DS](https://www.nintendo.com/consumer/downloads/manual-nintendo-2ds-operations-english.pdf)(page 77)), [Ap](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/OSX_Technology_Overview/SystemTechnology/SystemTechnology.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001067-CH207-BCICAIFJ)[p](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Darwin/Conceptual/KernelProgramming/BSD/BSD.html)[l](https://github.com/apple/darwin-xnu/search?q=bsd)[e](https://opensource.apple.com/source/Libc/Libc-320/string/FreeBSD/) and [Microsoft](https://lwn.net/Articles/245805/) have BSD licensed code bundled with their operating systems, Netflix mingles with FreeBSD since [they use it for their servers](https://inv.nadeko.net/watch?v=vcyQBup-Gto), etc.. These often are treated as "shareware" in some circles, but it is **not** to be equated with "public domain" content. While items in the public domain are similarly free to use for all, they have no owner(s)/ownership. **Permissive licenses *do* have an owner.** 

The BSD licenses nowadays can be simplified to "Don't claim you wrote this. Don't blame me if it breaks. Don't use my name to promote your product."

# How to choose a license / What licenses are available?

Think to yourself about what you want your software to accomplish. 

Would you want to ensure that everyone can be sure of what's within the code they're getting no matter what happens to it? 

Would you want to make sure that it can be used for things you might not have thought of it being used for? (For the sake of example, imagine building something with cars in mind and someone realizing that it would work in ships and airplanes too.)

Is this a hobby project and/or you just want your software to be available to whoever can make use of it, regardless of if they give back code or not? (a "private use" clause.)

Do you want people to even be able to make changes to your code?

Would you want to be noted as the person who created the software, or are you fine with not being explicitly acknowledged so long as they don't claim to have written it? Maybe you don't care about credit. 

If you're working with/for a community, what licenses are common/acceptable within them? This can have an impact on how readily accepted (or not) your contributions and changes will be.

There's a lot that can go into the decision and a lot of licenses for you to choose from that fit your specific (or general) needs.
That said, I advise against coming up with your own unique licenses. Whenever a new license pops up people need to do costly work to evaluate how enforcable they are and what licenses they're compatible with. There are thousands of licenses out there, not exactly cheap or fun times.
